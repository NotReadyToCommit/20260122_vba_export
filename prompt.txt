I'd like some help with coding project. I need a VBA script that runs in an excel file (.xlsm format). The excel file contains several sheets which each contain structured data. For simplicity, assume that the sheets are named {sheet_a, sheet_b, sheet_c} and that each of those worksheets contains a table named similarly. The follow the pattern that tbl_a is located in sheet_a and so on.  The file also contains a worksheet named "control" And that sheet contains a table named "tbl_control". The structure of tbl_control is: one row for each table in the workbook, with columns including each table's name, the sheet that table is located on, a filename to which we would like to export the table, the last export date/time, and the last exporter's username.
The VBA module we need to create should have two functions. The first should loop through each table within the workbook, check to see if that table is already in tbl_control, and if it is not, append a new row to tbl_control that contains its sheet name and table name. The other function should loop through the rows of tbl_control and for each row it should write the contents of the table specified by that row into a file with the name specified by that row. Assume for now that the filename is just the file name, not a full path. Also assume that we will use CSVs for simplicity, and that we will write each file into the working directory where the Excel file is stored at the time the macro is runs. After each file is successfully exported to CSV, overwrite the export information in tbl_control with the date/ time the files were exported and who exported them. For fun, assume we want to be able to export tbl_control each time too. If it is possible, it would be pretty cool to export a copy of the contents of the VBA module too at the end of the export run. That way we can use change control tools to monitor the VBA for changes over time too. If you have a better idea of how to monitor the VBA code over time please recommend it. I have not spent a lot of time using git with Excel so I don't know how to get git to show me differences between excel files over time
